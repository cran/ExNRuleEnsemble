Description: The extended neighbourhood rule for the k nearest neighbour ensemble where the neighbours are determined in k steps. Starting from the first nearest observation of the test point, the algorithm identifies a single observation that is closest to the observation at the previous step. At each base learner in the ensemble, this search is extended to k steps on a random bootstrap sample with a random subset of features selected from the feature space. The final predicted class of the test point is determined by using a majority vote in the predicted classes given by all base models.
